# AdventOfCode
Personal repo for posting my Advent Of Code solutions. The goal of this repo is to keep myself accountable

## Structure
Repo/Package will be split into years for Advent of Code, and then further split into by the Language, and then further into the Day.  Any tests will be included under that `Day` in the directory.  An additional `Info/Scratch` file may sometimes be included, and that will serve to help me to brainstorm and then after the fact start to consider ways to make my code better: More robust, more readable, more efficient or just a better overall solution that I might have later stumbled upon.

## Details
First round of the problem is aimed to be solved independently as best as possible. If unable to get through it, my goal is to use minimal help from Claude/ChatGPT, basically just a more advanced form of StackOverflow.
